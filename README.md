# ARCrow

ARCore is Googleâ€™s platform for building augmented reality experiences.
Using different APIs, ARCore enables your phone to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information.
Some of the APIs are available across Android and iOS to enable shared AR experiences.

ARCore uses three key capabilities to integrate virtual content with the real world as seen through your phone's camera:

Motion tracking allows the phone to understand and track its position relative to the world.
Environmental understanding allows the phone to detect the size and location of all type of surfaces: horizontal, vertical and angled surfaces like the ground, a coffee table or walls.
Light estimation allows the phone to estimate the environment's current lighting conditions.

Using ARCore and Sceneform SDK with a ScareCrow 3D model this app let's us learn about the basics of Augmented Reality apps.
